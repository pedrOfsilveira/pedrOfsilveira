### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643514239/2069/excited.gif?1643514239" width="25"/> 

I’m [**pedrO**](https://www.miraya.tech), a fullstack web developer based in Brazil.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is Vue.js, Quasar, Pinia, and Supabase. My favorite tools are Figma, Photoshop and Plane.

I’ve got a few pinned projects, but my favorite is [BlueBee](https://github.com/pedrOfsilveira/bluebee), a financial literacy PWA.

If you want to chat about code or opportunities, feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrofsilveira/).

#### Fun Facts:
* I'm into autumnal and halloweeny things
* I really enjoy cooking and trying new things
* **Interests:** 80s horror movies, gym, history, and archaeology
